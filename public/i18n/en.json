    "introduction": "Dubai’s real estate market is known for its luxury developments, high ROI, and investor-friendly regulations. But with so many off-plan properties and large transactions, how does the city ensure your money is protected?",
    "answer": "The answer: escrow accounts. These are legally required accounts that safeguard buyer funds and ensure developers only access money as construction progresses.",
    "guide": "In this guide, we’ll break down what an escrow account is, how it works in Dubai, and why it’s essential for anyone investing in property.",
    "what_Escrow_Account": "What is an Escrow Account?",
    "definition": "An escrow account is a special bank account where your payments for an off-plan property are securely held. This account is regulated by RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Agency) and is designed to protect buyers from fraud, delays, or project failure.",
    "developer_access": "The developer cannot touch your money until specific construction milestones are met and verified by an independent engineer.",
    "why_quettion": "Why Dubai Uses Escrow Accounts?",
    "why_dubai": "Dubai introduced escrow laws under Law No. (8) of 2007 to make the real estate market more secure and transparent. Before that, buyers would pay developers directly — which exposed them to major risks.",
    "today": "Today, escrow accounts are mandatory for all off-plan projects. This means:",
    "today_points": [
      "Developers must register the project and open an escrow account",
      "Payments go into this account, not to the developer",

    "how_it_protects": "Here’s what makes escrow accounts in Dubai so powerful for investors:",
    "benefits_list": [
      "Secure Payments: Your funds are locked in a regulated account and cannot be used freely by the developer.",
      "Progress-Based Releases: Money is only released after independent verification of construction progress.",
      "Minimized Risk: Prevents fraud, project delays, or incomplete developments.",
      "Regulatory Oversight: RERA monitors the accounts and ensures compliance with strict financial standards.",

    "title": "Freehold vs Leasehold in Dubai",
    "introduction": "If you're planning to invest in property in Dubai, you’ll quickly come across two terms: Freehold and Leasehold. While both are legally recognized forms of property ownership, they differ significantly — and understanding those differences is key to making the right investment decision.",
    "freehold_definition": "Freehold means you own the property and the land it’s built on — indefinitely. This type of ownership gives you full control and rights over the property.",
    "freehold_benefits": "You can live in it, rent it, sell it, or pass it on to your heirs without restrictions. In Dubai, foreign investors are allowed to buy freehold properties in designated zones, making this option highly popular among international buyers.",
    "freehold_areas": "Freehold properties are often located in prime areas such as Downtown Dubai, Dubai Marina, Business Bay, Dubai Hills, and Palm Jumeirah.",
    "leasehold_definition": "Leasehold means you own the property — but not the land — for a set period, usually 30 to 99 years. After that period, the property typically reverts to the original landowner unless renewed.",
    "leasehold_benefits": "You can still live in, rent out, or sell the lease, but there may be certain restrictions depending on the agreement.",
    "leasehold_areas": "Leasehold options are often more budget-friendly, and are commonly found in communities like Green Community, Jebel Ali, Discovery Gardens, and some parts of Dubai Silicon Oasis.",
    "differences": "Key Differences at a Glance",
    "differences_list": [
      "Ownership duration: Freehold is permanent; leasehold has a time limit.",
      "Land rights: With freehold, you own both property and land. With leasehold, you lease the property but not the land.",
      "Control: Freehold offers full control, while leasehold may involve limitations.",
      "Resale/inheritance: Freehold is fully transferable and inheritable. Leasehold may involve restrictions.",
      "Cost: Leasehold is usually more affordable upfront.",
      "Ideal buyer: Freehold suits long-term investors; leasehold may appeal to those looking for a shorter commitment or lower entry price."
    ],
    "which_to_choose": "Which One Should You Choose?",
    "which_to_choose_advice": "If you’re a long-term investor looking for maximum control, capital appreciation, and full legal ownership — freehold is the way to go. But if you're working with a more limited budget or seeking a short-to-mid-term investment, leasehold might be a practical option — as long as you're fully aware of the terms.",
    "contract_tip": "Always review the legal contract carefully, especially the lease duration, renewal clauses, and any ownership restrictions.",
    "final_thoughts": "Both freehold and leasehold properties can be smart investments in Dubai — the right choice depends on your financial goals, investment timeline, and risk appetite.",
